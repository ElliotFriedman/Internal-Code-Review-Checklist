# Audit Log Checklist

An audit log is a valuable resource for maintaining and enhancing the internal security posture of any codebase. It serves as a record of all changes made during the review, their justifications, and the assumptions that shaped the code. This checklist is designed to guide you in creating a comprehensive audit log that not only improves code quality and security, but also facilitates understanding for external reviewers and auditors. Consistently maintaining a detailed audit log should be part of your development process.

## Checklist

1. **Purpose of the meeting**: Clearly state the purpose and objectives of the code review meeting. This provides context for the actions and decisions recorded in the log.

2. **Contracts covered**: Detail the specific contracts or parts of the codebase that were covered in the review. This helps to easily track what areas of the code have been reviewed and where further attention may be needed.

3. **Issues found**: Log all issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities that were discovered during the review. Be as detailed as possible in your descriptions, which can help when revisiting these issues or explaining them to other team members or auditors.

4. **Proposed solutions to issues**: For every issue found, include the proposed solutions or remediation steps. This not only serves as a record of how issues are being addressed, but also aids in future reviews by illustrating how similar issues were resolved previously.

5. **Duration of break taken between writing this code**: Record the time taken between coding sessions. This data point might seem trivial, but stepping away from the code for over a day can provide a fresh perspective and aid in identifying potential issues that could have been missed previously.

This checklist serves as a general guide for creating an audit log and may need to be adapted to fit the specific needs and workflows of your team. Regular use of this checklist, combined with a thorough external audit, will help create a robust, secure, and high-quality codebase.
